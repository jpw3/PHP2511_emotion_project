# PHP2511_emotion_project

To-do Assignment #3 'First Steps', due 4/3/2019:

Goal - Replicate tables and figures for Experiment 1 (ratings on a variety of dimensions for different subjective feelings)

Steps to do this - 
0. Clean the data (huge data file that is messy, need to successfully unpack data)
1. Get data for 4 ratings of each emotion (4 basic dimensions are bodily saliency, mental saliency, emotion, and controllability) 
2. Plot the histograms from Figure 1 for Experiment 1
3. Run Pearson correlations without clustering to get an idea of how these dimensions of feeling are related to each other

Next steps needed after this assignment - 

0. Map the topographical space for bodily emotions using a density based clustering and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (clustering algorithms; alternative would be a KNN approach, possibly for the extension part of this project?)
