welcome || Sensations in the mind and body
welcome_text || In this experiment we study how much different sensations, states and actions are felt in the mind and the body. You are shown words denoting different states and sensations. For each state or sensation, you are asked to evaluate  how much you feel it in the mind, and how much you feel it in the body. Note that you can report feeling the same thing in both your mind and body. <br><br>You are also asked to evaluate how pleasant each state or sensation feels, how often you feel or do it, and how much you can control it. Completing the experiment takes about 10 minutes.<br><br>Participating is voluntary and you may end the experiment at any time. All data will be analyzed confidentially. Responses are anonymous and you cannot be recognized on the basis of your responses. Only the researchers directly involved in the project can access the data. This project is conducted by Lauri Nummenmaa, Enrico Glerean, Riitta Hari, Mikko Sams (Aalto University) and Jari Hietanen (University of Tampere).<br><br>Enquiries and comments may be sent to Enrico Glerean (enrico.glerean@aalto.fi).
